# Code test

Hi, and welcome to this code test. üëã

This traveller API‚Ñ¢ is for the busy traveller who, in a post-covid world, is free to travel the world. ‚úàüåç

It's meant to solve a specific problem, namely to help when your boarding cards are not in order.

Scenario: Your cat spilled the morning coffe all over you stack of boarding cards, messing up their order and smuding the flight times and dates. You can, however, use the magic of the traveller API to help out sorting the boarding cards. One snag; the implementation is missing!

You assignment is to implement a REST-endpoint in the current project, taking an unordered list of boarding cards and returing them in the correct order. The only information given is a list of start and end IATA codes for each part of the trip.

Example: The cards, ```GOT-ARN, HEL-GOT, CPH-HEL``` would be re-ordered as ```CPH-HEL, HEL-GOT, GOT-ARN```, representing a trip from Copenhagen (CPH) to Stockholm (ARN), via both Helsinki (HEL) and Gothenburg (GOT).

# Additional questions
* Assuming trips can contain thousands of parts, how will your alorithm perform, i.e What's the time complexity of the current algorithm?
* What (if any) additional tests would you add?
